1. What’s stdint.h?
Ans - typedefs and macros for making int variable of custom size

2. What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
Ans - You can fill up exactly the amount of space you want in a file
    uint8_t = unsigneed integer 8 bit , uint32_t = unsigneed integer 32 bit ,
    int32_t = integer 32 bit
    
3. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
Ans - BYTE = 1 byte
    DWORD= 4 bytes
    LONG = 4 bytes
    WORD = 2 bytes

4. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be?
(Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers.)"
Ans.

Hex:    0x424d
ASCII:  BM (bitmap!)

5. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
Ans. bfSize - total number of bytes in the file
    biSize - number of bytes in the info header

6. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
Ans. the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner

7. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits
per pixel)?
Ans. biBitCount

8. Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
Ans. when it can't find the file then it will return NULL

9. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
Ans. 1 represent read here

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign  to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
Ans. int padding =  (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4;
        = (4 - ( 3 * (3*1) )%4 ) %4
        = 3

11. What does fseek do?
Ans. it moves pointer to a specific location in a file

12. What is SEEK_CUR?
Ans. the current file position of cursor
